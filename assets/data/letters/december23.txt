December 23rd

Hey there!
Word from the street has told 
me that the theater's opening 
up soon! I've heard there's 
still some bugs to squash in 
there, but they'll be showing 
a premiere of the Holiday 
Network on the 24th at 6 pm 
EST! After that, they'll be 
premiering another animation, 
LUCKYBOY, the next day at the 
same time. Sit back, grab 
something at the Cafe, and 
have some fun!

Enjoy the premiere,
-Tom

P.s. The only entrance is 
through the back - please 
don't cause another fire 
in there!
