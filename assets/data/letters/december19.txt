December 19th

Long ago I realized Flash Cartoons
would be a staple of Newgrounds'
identity on the web. We all enjoy
the bright colors, the smear frames,
and the line boiling. Now it's time
to enjoy those features on the big-
but-sorta-small screen!

I've unlocked the door to my home
theater and as a special treat I'll
be screening a BRAND NEW "Duncan
and Jones" cartoon by Snackers.

See you at the premiere 6pm EST,
