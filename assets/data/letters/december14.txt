December 14th

Hello again!
Sorry for the delay in our 
correspondence, my normal 
sized letters kept getting 
marked "return to sender" 
by P-Bot, but I finally found 
some paper small enough for 
toy town. 

I hope you've been enjoying 
the drinks at the new grounds 
cafe as much as I do, plus I 
hear the mini movie theater
will be open real soon.

Smell ya l8tr,
-Tom
