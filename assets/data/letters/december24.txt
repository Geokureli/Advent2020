December 24th

Twas the Night Before Christmas 
and... you know, this classic story 
has been told too many times. Let’s 
switch things up a bit and add a 
twist! How about we write a story 
that revolves around Tankmas?! 
That sounds like a good idea.

We’ll call it, ‘Twas the Night 
Before Tankmas' a story so grand, 
I know of some voices and the 
perfect background band! This gift 
I've already left in the foyer to 
show, but don't open before 6pm or 
else I will know!

A second present as well on this 
pre-Christmas night, a cartoon by 
several with the mood set just 
right. Come join me in my theatre 
later this evening, both are truly 
two stories that are well worth 
hearing!

See you at the premiere at 9pm EST,
