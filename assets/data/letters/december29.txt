December 29th

We've had a wonderful time and
there is still more in store for
ADVENT yet! Just now we've added
a new highscore minigame to the 
arcade!

To the first Newgrounds user to
achieve a score of 300,000 in 
Holiday Hominid Drop will recieve 
One Year Supporter Status ;D

Good luck, I'll be watching,
