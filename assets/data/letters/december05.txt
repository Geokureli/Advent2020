December 5th

This is a bit embarassing, but it
seems I accidentally locked the
front door shut on you all. It
slipped my mind that I was having
guests over while the manor was
being fumigated. I'd suggest you 
get some fresh air from outside 
immediately! Though it's been a
few days so the inside should be...

...relatively safe now.

Let's touch base again soon!
