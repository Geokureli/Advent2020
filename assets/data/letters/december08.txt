December 8th

I finally got around to renovating
the arcade, it's quite small and
there's no Nightmare Cops, but 
I do have a fine collection of
original games and bootlegs
among the cabinets!

Right now there's only one game,
but I'm getting some more repaired
soon so visit often!

See you on the leaderboards,
