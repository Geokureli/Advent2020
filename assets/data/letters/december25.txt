December 25th
Merry Christmas [NAME]!

I hope you've been enjoying the
festivities so far in Tiny Town.
Being that it is Christmas I 
delivered a bunch of extra gifts 
over to the Town Hall, just above 
the hill in the back.

Don't forget to join us for the
exciting release of the film
"LUCKYBOY" in our own theater
at 6pm EST. See you there!

P.s. Dress up in your LUCKYBOY
cosplay as Brooke or Lucky in
Pico's Apparel.
