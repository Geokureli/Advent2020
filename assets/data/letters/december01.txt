December 1st
Merry Tankmas [NAME]!

I know the invites list the same 
address this year, but times are 
tough and CVS costs 30 cents a
copy. 

Last year we gave away tons of 
drawing tablets to NG users across 
the world, but bad news is those 
didnâ€™t come cheap. 

But the celebration must continue! 
There's be a small town southeast 
of here willing to tolerate our 
party. I'll send more letters when 
you check in with the post office.

P.s. Let all your rich friends 
know I'm subletting the manor!
