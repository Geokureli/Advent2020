January 2nd

[NG USER], if you're still here 
you'll be happy to know the ghost 
problem has been resolved. The 
party's over, but you're welcome 
to hang around so long as you keep
it down and don't wake my kids; 
enjoy the arcade or rewatch old 
movies. I hope you made some 
awesome TANKMAS memories. I 
personally cannot wait for next 
year!

Thank you for being the best part 
of Newgrounds, 
-Tom
