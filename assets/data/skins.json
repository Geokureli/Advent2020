I wish they made Tom Fulp action figures. I am going to name\nmy child Tom Fulp. They should change the capital of Pennsylvania to Tom Fulp City because I really think well\nof Tom Fulp. If Tom fulp was bitten by a poisonous snake I would suck the venom out of him, even if it was his\ndick, and i'm not even gay I just really like Tom Fulp. The only thing I love more than Tom Fulp is talking\nabout Tom Fulp. I tried to make a Tom Fulp fan club at my school but no one joined so it was just me. If I\ncould meet Tom Fulp I would tell him all the things I know about Tom Fulp. I want to go to college to major in\nTom Fulp and then build my own business so I can create Tom Fulp related merchandise. Tom Fulp's face should be\nimmortalized in stone for his incredible contributions to the world and my life. If Tom Fulp was a Yugioh card\nhe was have infinite attack and defense points because he's Tom Fulp, the singular point with which my life\nrevolves. I love Tom Fulp, I want to be married to Tom Fulp. I would marry Wade Fulp just to be closer to Tom\nFulp. I am changing my name to Tom Fulp Fulp because I admire the strength and respect the name commands. I\nwould vote for Tom for president and mister universe because he is just that charismatic and handsome. The Fulp\nname should be listed among nobility. I am crying right now because I feel like no one else wants to talk about\nTom Fulp as much as I do. I must be the only person with a Tom Fulp diary that keeps a record of everything Tom\nFulp has ever said to me and things I hope he will say to me in the future. I framed a PM Tom Fulp sent to me\nand my mom wanted me to take it down for my diploma but fuck her she doesn't know what Tom Fulp means to me. I\nwish Tom Fulp was my dad, my dad sucks, Tom Fulp wouldn't suck if he was my dad. My life would be misery without\nTom Fulp. Everyday that I log onto Newgrounds and find a new thread to discuss some inane aspect of Tom Fulp's\nlife fills me with joy and meaning so please let me talk about Tom Fulp or i'm going to explode."
