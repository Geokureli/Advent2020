I wish they made Tom Fulp action figures. I am going to name my\nchild Tom Fulp. They should change the capital of Pennsylvania to Tom Fulp City because I really think well of Tom\nFulp. If Tom fulp was bitten by a poisonous snake I would suck the venom out of him, even if it was his dick, and\nI'm not even gay I just really like Tom Fulp. The only thing I love more than Tom Fulp is talking about Tom Fulp. I\ntried to make a Tom Fulp fan club at my school but no one joined so it was just me. If I could meet Tom Fulp I would\ntell him all the things I know about Tom Fulp. I want to major in Tom Fulp in college and then build my own business\nso I can create Tom Fulp related merchandise. Tom Fulp's face should be immortalized in stone for his incredible\ncontributions to the world and my life. If Tom Fulp was a Yugioh card he was have infinite attack and defense points\nbecause he's Tom Fulp, the singular point with which my life revolves. I love Tom Fulp, I want to be married to Tom\nFulp. I would marry Wade Fulp just to be closer to Tom Fulp. I am changing my name to Tom Fulp Fulp because I admire\nthe strength and respect the name commands. I would vote for Tom for president and mister universe because he is\njust that charismatic and handsome. The Fulp name should be listed among nobility. I am crying right now because I\nfeel like no one else wants to talk aboutTom Fulp as much as I do. I must be the only person with a Tom Fulp diary\nthat keeps a record of everything Tom Fulp has ever said to me and things I hope he will say to me in the future. I\nframed a PM Tom Fulp sent to me and my mom wanted me to take it down for my diploma but fuck her she doesn't know what\nTom Fulp means to me. I wish Tom Fulp was my dad, my dad sucks, Tom Fulp wouldn't suck if he was my dad. My life would\nbe misery without Tom Fulp. Everyday that I log onto Newgrounds and find a new thread to discuss some inane aspect of\nTom Fulp's life fills me with joy and meaning so please let me talk about Tom Fulp or I'm going to explode."
