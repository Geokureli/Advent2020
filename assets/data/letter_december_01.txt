December 1st
Welcome, [NG USER]!

As you know the holidays are coming up and I was sitting in my luxurious twelve-story-office feeling glum that there was no Pico Day celebration in 2020. To correct this injustice I decided to open my grand home manor to the public for a one-month-long bash hereby known as TANKMAS! There's presents, there's games, there's movies, slammin' jams,  and more! It's got all your favorite celebrations minus the dreidel, so get dressed and go mingle with the other guests! 

Have a happy holidays and a grand TANKMAS ADVENTure,
-Tom

P.s. Spooky month got a little out of hand this year. I'm sending someone to clean up after New Year's Day. I wonder what the Ghost Squado is up to...
